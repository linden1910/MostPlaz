# MostPlaz
Simple LinuxCNC QtPyVCP Gui for 3 axis Plazma Cutter.
This is very much a work in progress the ui design is more or less complete.
There is nothing behind it and no funcionality if buttons are clicked.

Notes:
most_plaz_vcp folder contains .hal and .ini files for linuxcnc sim config

Install editable "pip install -e ."
