Description: # MostPlaz
        Simple LinuxCNC QtPyVCP Gui for 3 axis Plazma Cutter.
        This is very much a work in progress the ui design is more or less complete.
        There is nothing behind it and no funcionality if buttons are clicked.
        
        Notes:
        most_plaz_vcp folder contains .hal and .ini files for linuxcnc sim config
